# GLASS: Gateway Language Access to Spigot Software.

## Eventually this will support

- Rust
- JavaScript
- Java (API Refactor)

### Concept

The GLASS library will provide ways for other languages to communicate with the library via JNI, the library will then
execute actions via the spigot api conceptually making plugins from other languages!
