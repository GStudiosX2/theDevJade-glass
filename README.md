# GLASS: Gateway Language Access to Spigot Software.

## Eventually this will support
- Rust
- JavaScript
- Java (API Refactor)

### Concept
The GLASS library will provide ways for other languages to communicate with the library via JNI, the library will then execute actions via the spigot api conceptually making plugins from other languages!
